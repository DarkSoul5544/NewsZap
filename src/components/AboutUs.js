      <p>
        NewsZap was founded in 2024 by a group of experienced journalists and
        technologists who saw a need for a new kind of news organization â€“ one
        that was committed to providing accurate, timely, and unbiased news
        coverage, and that was not beholden to any particular political or
        ideological agenda. Since then, we have grown to become one of the most
        popular news websites in the world, with millions of readers from around
        the globe.
